It uses ANSI escape codes for changing colors and clearing the screen.

To clone it and run use:
```
git clone https://github.com/boggless-github/2048.git
cd 2048
make run
```
It works in Linux and WSL. No dependencies besides having a recent version of g++

Then in game, use WASD/wasd then hit enter for each move.
